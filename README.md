# multicore-web-app
A web app designed specifically to attend to my daily needs, such as logging thoughts, journaling, registering my daily weigh-ins, tracking the foods I consume for macro and micronutrient tracking, and, finally but not least, my progress at the gym. With all sorts of calculations, I have decided to name thisweb app as Multicore.
